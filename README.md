# DawgTweaks
A collection of small modifications for Minecraft. Built upon Minecraft Forge. This is mostly just an opportunity for me to screw around with Forge, but if someone else sees value in it then they are more than welcome to use it.

# Licence and Redistribution
Do whatever you want, just make sure to credit me (jdawg3636). I would also appreciate it if you change the name of modified versions to avoid confusion, but I'm not going to enforce that. Use your best judgement.
